## Release 0.3.0 | ðŸ“† Jan 09, 2024

FINALLY! Our first early build has been released - marking a major milestone with networked multiplayer.

*Because this update is less of a vertical slice and more like a tech demo, we opted not to distribute it for now.*

## Release 0.3.1 | ðŸ“† Jan 16, 2024

We hit another major milestone with code cleanup and refactoring of network functionality:

- lobby/matchmaking server and matches all live in a single process now
- several bugs were addressed
- improved new-player setup flow

*Because this update is less of a vertical slice and more like a networking tech demo, we're distributing it by request only.*
