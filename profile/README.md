## ðŸ‘‹Welcome

Crystal Expedition is a joint venture in pursuit of creating new game experiences.

We're working toward something big and plan to create several micro-games along the way to develop our skills and experiences as part-time game designers.

## ðŸ‘¥Who Are We?

Crystal Expedition began with two [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) modders ([Kanaverum](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson) and [Shavick](https://github.com/Shavick)) who love building and refining new experiences.

Two buddies met in "Guppy's Unofficial 7 Days to Die Modding Server" and supported the community in several ways while producing and releasing mods of their own.

Kanaverum focused on server-side-only modding (lots of C# and network programming/optimization) to dive into making new/experimental experiences as accessible as possible for players on his server, `Fatal Expedition`.

Shavick focused on leveraging the power and capability of Unity to create entirely new assets and client-side experiences in his overhaul mod, `Crystal Hell`.

> `Crystal Expedition` is a name formed in memory of the two journeys and a shout-out of appreciation to the communities that formed around them.

After careful consideration, we decided to launch a new project with longer-term goal: designing an open-world multiplayer survival/crafting game with complete systems powered by hand-crafted, non-deterministic AI [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system). We're taking inspiration from the [incredible stories shared by the Dwarf Fortress team](https://www.eurogamer.net/why-dwarf-fortress-started-killing-cats) ([buy it here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/)) and concepts around [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) ([experience it here](https://playgameoflife.com/)).

Pursuit of something like this requires plenty of preparation: at best, it'll take us years to learn [Unity](https://unity.com/) and possibly [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/); at worst, we'll have learned more about at least 1 Game Engine.

Instead of targeting a single long-term goal, we decided to target lots of little goals as milestones by making several small games. This will help us learn to plan, develop, polish, market, and release several small (very focused) games by focusing on concepts/features/technologies we plan to include in our larger game development plans.

That's where you come in (hopefully); we're hoping to create these interesting, byte-sized experiences and would love to give most or all of them away for free! We only ask for feedback so we can learn more from these experiences to make them better or at least to avoid any mistakes we've made in the past when we incorporate those game elements into the larger idea we're working toward.

Thanks for us on our journey to crafting experiences we can all enjoy!
