## üëãWelcome

Crystal Expedition is a joint venture in pursuit of creating new game experiences.

We're working toward something big and plan to create several micro-games along the way to develop our skills and experiences as part-time game designers.

## üë•Who Are We?

Crystal Expedition began with two [7 Days to Die](https://7daystodie.com/) modders ([Kanaverum](https://github.com/jonathan-robertson) and [Shavick](https://github.com/Shavick)) who love building and refining new experiences.

These two buddies met in "Guppy's Unofficial 7 Days to Die Modding Server" and supported the community in several ways while producing and releasing mods of their own.

Kanaverum focused on server-side-only modding (lots of C# and network programming/optimization) to dive into making new/experimental experiences as accessible as possible for players on his server, `Fatal Expedition`.

Shavick focused on leveraging the power and capability of Unity to create entirely new assets and client-side experiences in his overhaul mod, `Crystal Hell`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `Crystal Expedition` is a name formed in memory of the two journeys and a shout-out of appreciation to the communities that formed around them.

### Future Plans

After careful consideration, we decided to launch a new project with longer-term goal: designing an open-world multiplayer survival/crafting game with complete systems powered by hand-crafted, non-deterministic AI [expert system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system). We're taking inspiration from the [incredible stories shared by the Dwarf Fortress team](https://www.eurogamer.net/why-dwarf-fortress-started-killing-cats) ([buy it here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/975370/Dwarf_Fortress/)) and concepts around [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) ([experience it here](https://playgameoflife.com/)).

Pursuit of something like this requires plenty of preparation: at best, it'll take us years to learn how to leverage a game engine to produce something as large and complex as 7 Days + Dwarf Fortress but we'll make it happen in the end... or at worst, we'll have learned more about how to build games from scratch!

Instead of targeting a single long-term goal, we decided to target lots of little goals as milestones by making several small games. This will help us learn to plan, develop, polish, market, and release several small (very focused) games by prioritizing the concepts/features/technologies we plan to include in our larger game development plans.

### Engagement

We're hoping to create these interesting, byte-sized experiences we would love to build a community around! We'll be interested in your feedback as we learn how to provide solid, engaging experiences and work toward our larger project.

Thanks for joining us on our journey to crafting experiences we can all enjoy!
